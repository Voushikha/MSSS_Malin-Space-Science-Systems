			<summary>
				Sensor A records data that represents a Gaussian distribution
				(also known as normal distribution) it is a bell-shaped curve.
				It is assumed that during any measurement, values will follow a normal
				distribution with an equal number of measurements above and below the mean value (mu).
			</summary>
			<param name="mu">The mean of the distribution</param>
			<param name="sigma">The standard deviation of the distribution</param>
			<returns>A data reading within a Gaussian Distribution rounded to 4 decimal points</returns>

			<summary>
				Sensor B records data that represents a Box-Muller distribution
				(also known as normal distribution) it is a bell-shaped curve.
				It is assumed that during any measurement, values will follow a normal
				distribution with an equal number of measurements above and below the mean value (mu).
